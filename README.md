# dnsbox
dnsbox is a fortran code for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) 
of the sinusoidally forced Navier-Stokes equations 
(Kolmogorov flow) in a triply periodic domain. 

The version provided here is identical to the one used for the results 
of

## Compilation

To compile in a Linux environment, you need the development libraries of:
 - `openmpi`
 - `fftw3`
 - `BLAS`
 - `LAPACK`

and `GFortran` (version 9 or higher).
On Ubuntu,
the packages "`build-essential gfortran libfftw3-dev libopenmpi-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev`"
should be sufficient.

To compile the simulator, do
```
make
```

## Running

Simulations are started from a pair of files:
`state.000000` containing the state data and `parameters.in` containing
the physical, output and debugging parameters.

Such a sample initial condition that leads to turbulence with a lifetime
longer than 10 000 is in `test/`.
To run it, you can create a folder, say, `rundir`,
```
mkdir rundir
```
copy the simulator binary (`dns.x`), the initial condition (`state.000000`) and the parameter input file
(`parameters.in`) there,
```
cp dns.x rundir/
cp test/* rundir/
```
go to `rundir`,
```
cd rundir
```
and run the simulator on `N` cores, detaching from the terminal, and redirecting
`stdout` (`1`) and `stderr` (`2`) to the file `log`,
```
nohup mpirun -np N dns.x > log 2>&1 &
```
Take note of the output process ID, say `123456`, you can use it to kill
the simulation,
```
kill 123456
```
unless it stops by itself due to laminarization, runtime limits (see `parameters.in`) 
or errors.

One can also start simulations from random initial conditions by setting `IC` to `-1`.

## Utilities

As the run goes on, it will write state files (`state.123456`) and a file
containing observables and time-stepper data (`stat.gp`).
To visualize `stat.gp`, you can do
```
dnsstats ./ 0 -1
```
